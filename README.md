## Notes
- All solutions are written in C++ unless otherwise specified
- Some problems have multiple implementations (e.g., Two Sets has both C++ and Ruby solutions)
- Solutions follow competitive programming best practices with fast I/O optimizations

## Problem Categories
- **Introductory Problems**: Basic algorithmic thinking and implementation
- **Sorting and Searching**: Array manipulation, binary search, greedy algorithms
- More categories to be added as I progress...

## Running Solutions
To compile and run any C++ solution:
```bash
g++ -o solution ProblemName.cpp
./solution < input.txt
```

Or for online judges:
```bash
g++ -std=c++17 -O2 -Wall ProblemName.cpp -o ProblemName
```
