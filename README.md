### Graph Algorithms
- **Dijkstra's Algorithm Variations**: The CSES set showcases several powerful variations:
  - State-Space Dijkstra (Flight Discount)
  - K-Shortest Paths (Flight Routes) 
  - Augmented Information Dijkstra (Investigation)
- **Cycle Detection**: Different approaches for directed vs undirected graphs
- **Union-Find**: Path compression and union by rank optimizations

### Sorting and Searching Patterns
- **Two Pointers**: O(n) solutions for sorted arrays (Sum of Two Values, Ferris Wheel)
- **Sliding Window**: Variable-size windows with hash maps (Playlist)
- **Sweep Line**: Event processing algorithms (Restaurant Customers)
- **Binary Search on Answer**: Find optimal values through binary search
- **Greedy + Binary Search**: Optimal placement with sorted structures (Towers)
- **Kadane's Algorithm**: Maximum subarray sum in O(n)
- **Median Property**: Minimizes sum of absolute deviations (Stick Lengths)

### Advanced Data Structures
- **Set/Multiset**: Sorted containers with O(log n) operations
- **Dynamic Segments**: Maintaining intervals with set operations (Traffic Lights)
- **Position Tracking**: Hash maps for last occurrence positions
- **Coordinate Compression**: Map large values to small indices

### Mathematical Insights
- **Missing Coin Sum**: Gap-finding with consecutive sum property
- **Activity Selection**: Sort by end time for greedy scheduling
- **Josephus Problem**: Simulation vs mathematical formula approaches

### Common Patterns
- **Greedy Algorithms**: Often optimal for scheduling and assignment problems
- **DFS/BFS**: Grid traversal, connectivity, shortest paths
- **Dynamic Programming**: Optimal substructure and overlapping subproblems

### Implementation Tips
- Use `long long` for large numbers to avoid overflow
- Fast I/O with `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); cin.tie(NULL);`
- STL containers: `set`, `multiset`, `priority_queue`, `deque`
- Graph representation: adjacency lists for sparse graphs
- Binary search: `lower_bound` vs `upper_bound` for different constraints
