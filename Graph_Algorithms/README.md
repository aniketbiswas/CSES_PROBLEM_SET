## Algorithm Notes

### Dijkstra's Algorithm Variations
The CSES set showcases several powerful variations of Dijkstra's algorithm:

1. **State-Space Dijkstra** (Flight Discount): Track multiple states per vertex
2. **K-Shortest Paths** (Flight Routes): Find multiple optimal solutions
3. **Standard Dijkstra** (Shortest Routes I): Classic single-source shortest path

See the [Dijkstra Variations Guide](../docs/dijkstra-variations.md) for detailed explanations.
