# Graph Algorithms

Graph theory problems including traversal, shortest paths, and connectivity.

## Problems Solved (4/36)

1. **Counting Rooms** (`CountingRooms.cpp`) - Count connected components using DFS/BFS
2. **Labyrinth** (`Labyrinth.cpp`) - Find shortest path in grid maze using BFS
3. **Building Roads** (`BuildingRoads.cpp`) - Connect all cities using minimum roads
4. **Message Route** (`MessageRoute.cpp`) - Find shortest path between two nodes

## Key Concepts
- DFS and BFS traversal
- Connected components
- Shortest path algorithms (BFS for unweighted graphs)
- Grid-based pathfinding
- Union-Find (Disjoint Set Union)
