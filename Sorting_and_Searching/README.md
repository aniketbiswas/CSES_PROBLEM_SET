# Sorting and Searching

This section focuses on array manipulation, binary search, and greedy algorithms.

## Problems Solved

1. **Distinct Numbers** (`DistinctNumCount.cpp`) - Count unique elements
2. **Apartments** (`Apartments.cpp`) - Assign apartments to applicants
3. **Ferris Wheel** (`FerrisWheel.cpp`) - Optimize gondola usage
4. **Concert Tickets** (`ConcertTickets.cpp`) - Ticket assignment with price constraints

## Key Concepts
- Sorting algorithms
- Binary search
- Two pointers technique
- Greedy algorithms
- Data structures (set, multiset)
- Time complexity optimization
